Build
=====

Use Makefile



Run
===

./bin/plagcheck <folder in which the files needs to be checked>

Note : The result folder should be cleared before running the program, as all the outputs would be written there.




Output
======

The main output is displayed in the terminal and also written in results/results.

All the file in the folder which is specified are given number, (0 to n).
The first file is 0 and so on.

If the percentage match > allowed percentage, then its result is displayed.
The format of the output is:

(i,j)
Path of the ith program
Path of the jth program
Match - Match percentage

Example : 
(1,6)
test/assignment3/matrix1.s
test/assignment3/architec.txt
Match - 12.0567%

Next, the details of the matched blocks between program i and program j can be found in result/i_j
Example, for (1,6), the details would be in file 1_6

In that file, the output example is shown : 
The matched blocks are :
1st program : 
Line 42:	mov r0,0
Line 43:	mov r3,0x100
Line 44:	mov r4,0x200
Line 45:	mov r5,0x300

2nd program : 
Line 83:mov r0,0x100
Line 84:mov r1,0x200
Line 85:mov r2,0x300

Note : The files are made only for those matches whose match percentage is greater than the allowed percentage.



Matrix and factors controlling output
======================================

Three factors can control the output which are defined in include/plagcheck.h : 
#define threshold 1
#define minblock 2
#define allow 10

where :
threshold is the maximum lenshtein distance below which two blocks are considered a match.
minblock is the minimum block size above which two blocks are considered a match.
allow is the allowed match percentage, if the percentage match is greater than allow, only then it is considered for plagiarism.


Matrix = [{Summation over all matched blocks (blocksize/levenshtein+1)}/{Total inst in prog 1 + prog 2}] * (threshold +1) * 100

where matched blocks are block A of program 1 and block B of program 2 if their :
i) Levenshtein distance <= threshold
ii) blocksize > minblock
where blocksize = min(blockA.size, blockB.size)
